# Data-Collection-Challenge

This repo demonstrates the use of beautiful soup to open and scrape a website for various types of data.

Part 1: The goal of this code was to scrape a Mars specific news page for article titles and summaries for the various stories on the page. The titles and summaries were scraped from the website and presented in the ipynb.

Part 2: The goal of this code was to scrape data from a table on a website that described various dimensions of the temperature on Mars. Headers and data were scraped from the website table and made into a DataFrame for easy analysis. Several graphs were able to be generated from this tabular data to better visualize and understand patterns of the temperature on Mars.
